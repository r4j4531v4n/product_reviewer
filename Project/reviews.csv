                                    Dear all,,
     Moto g an outstanding product. But facing disappointment by the product.,
I replaced one moto g. Faced problem with its earpiece speaker. voice was getting shattered from speaker. ,
      For that product Flipkart sent an apology saying they have sent defective product by mistake. ,
          But now again with other replaced product I am facing the same problem. And this time voice shaterring  is so much worsened i cannot understand what opposite person saying. So i had to restrict my use to msging and whats app.,
     Its a service review not a product.,
                                                                  From a disappointed customer.                                 "

                                    Bought this Moto G phone and there is a damage on the display. Went to the service center but there is not agreement between motorolla and service providers regarding the out of warranty Moto G support.,
Product has bee sold out before a month ago and till now they didnt finalize the service rules for warranty and no warranty.,
Very worst support form Motorola.                                "

                                    In the box:,
Moto G,
Wall charger,
Wired headset,
Quick start guides in Hindi and English,
Warranty card,
The Phone:,
It's a vibrant HD screen that's just the right size and has a clean, stock Android interface. Viewing angles are limited but I don't mind this because it means people can't peek around your shoulder.,
The phone feels premium to hold and processing power is good, so's the RAM and the phone barely lags (though it does occasionally slow down when changing apps). The matte back panel of the phone has an extremely pleasing texture but is also a smudge magnet. Also, no screen guard was provided in the box and none can be found on flipkart.,
Both these problems, however, are solved by the flip cover I purchased with the phone, which is even more premium. The thoughtfully located Moto logo has a depression perfect for my index finger, and the magnetic felt-lined cover will autolock or unlock and clean fingerprints on your phone when you flip it. ,
The Cameras:,
No amount of smooth scrolling will make up for the halfpenny back camera and the severely inadequate 1.3 MP front camera. Although the camera is capable of shooting slo-mo videos (this is really, really cool), they are grainy and jerky. Movement in the video is not smooth and I can only put this down to low FPS. The camera is unusable in low light and is average at best in normal light. The LED flash is blinding.,
The Battery:,
Although it's too soon to say anything about battery life, from my estimates it should do 24 hrs on one full charge with moderate wifi and 3G use.,
The Accessories:,
Apart from the phone, everything in the box was majorly disappointing. The headphones feel cheap, sound substandard and are really not worth reviewing. No data cable was included in the box. Instead I received only a micro-usb wall charger. Hello, moto?,
UPDATE: I attempted to transfer files with several data cables on multiple computers and there is a glaring issue here: the phone does not stay connected for more than two minutes at a time. Windows Explorer hangs when i try to transfer multiple albums simultaneously as they take longer than 2 mins to transfer. When I first plug it into the PC it is recognised as device XT1033 but then 2 mins later it just drops off the PC and all transfers hang. Then I have to manually disconnect and reconnect the data cable, and I have another 2 minute window to transfer files before it drops off again. The phone is charging all this while, though.,
I am getting in touch with flipkart about this issue.,
UPDATE 2: I turned on USB debugging through the Developer Options and this has apparently resolved the connection-drop issue. No cause could be found for the issue I faced earlier. I will update if it returns. ,
It is worth noting that the loudspeaker is incredibly powerful and distortion-free. The ear-speaker unit is also fairly loud and does the job.,
I had come to the comforting conclusion that 8 GB models were finally out of fashion - it's 2014. Evidently I was wrong. I strongly urge everyone to invest the extra 1.5k for a 16 GB model.,
I must also mention that the power button and volume rockers were crisp and responsive when the phone arrived but have become loose within 8 hours - what the hell? ,
Price - 7/10,
Build quality - 8/10,
Pros:,
Solid build - water resistant, Corning Gorilla Glass 3,
Premium feel,
Excellent for everyday use,
Stock Android interface + 4.4 Kitkat update imminent,
Critically acclaimed price-point,
Cons:,
Mediocre cameras - both of em,
In-the-box accessories are worthless,
No screenguard included or available online, but problem solved by flipcover,
No expandable memory, though it supports OTG,
Motorola Device ID - the world renowned lost phone tracker - is not available in India ,
Verdict:,
Worthy of the hype. Almost worth the price. One of the best deals under 15k. ,
P.s.,
It took me 6 tries to get to the payment page because by the time I would get there it would be sold out, and I'd have to refresh the product page. Then when I finally placed the order at around 1315 hrs, it kept alternating between ""payment succesfully completed"" and ""transaction incomplete"". Then at 1350 hrs it finally stabilised to ""payment successfully completed"". Then flipkart started adding random orders for the 8 GB version which I had never placed. These orders are still visible now in my track orders list, even though I never placed them. They were cancelled when I called their helpline number and they revealed there were multiple technical breakdowns because of a massive influx of customers. I received my phone the next day as per the guarantee.                                "

                                    Purchased Moto G 16 GB On 06-Feb-14, Received Faulty Device, SIM 1 Slot Is Not Detecting Any SIM,
THE BEST PART IS THAT FLIPKART DELETES MY REVIEW AFTER FEW DAYS, THIS IS THE 3RD TIME THAT I AM WRITING THE SAME REVIEW ,
I had purchased a Moto G 16GB handset on 06-Feb-2014. The product was delivered on the evening of 10-Feb-2014. However, I have received a Faulty handset. The SIM 1 slot in the phone does not recognize any SIM Card. The SIM 2 slot works fine. I have tried different SIM cards but facing the same issue with SIM 1 slot. ,
I have raised a complaint regarding this on 11-Feb-2014 . I am very disappointed with the the fact that it took 3 days and around 5 calls from my side before I could  get an update from Flipkart,
Finally, on 13-Feb-2014 I called Flipkart and they told me that they would refund me the money as the item is out of stock. The refund process would take around 10 working days after the defective productive is picked up.,
They did not even bother providing me a replacement for the defective item. Instead they offered me the refund for which i have to wait for another 10-15 days.It seemed as if they were doing a great favor by offering me a refund.My point is if I do not get the handset then what was the point in taking all the pain to buy this product at a premium price on the day it was launched and on top of that I have to wait for 10-15 days for the refund. Who pays up for my lost time, effort and money????,
I am very disappointed with the kind of service that has been provided by Flipkart. I am an avid online shopper and this experience will really make me think before purchasing any item from Flipkart.,
My advice to fellow online shoppers....think well before you purchase this product from Flipkart.......you may very well land up in a situation where you receive a defective item and then you get stuck up with the refund process which would take around 10-15 days. ,
There are numerous shoppers who have received defective Moto G (16GB) phones and lamenting on the purchase with no update on when it would get replaced.                                "

                                    Ok so, I am sure you would have read how good this phone is and the awesome value for money proposition it provides. No debating that - the phone is awesome. But how good is a phone if you cannot make a call from it?,
To cut long story short, the network drops regularly and the phone automatically switches to airplane mode. The SIM cards are not recognised and there is no apparent reason for this. The only way to fix this is to remove the SIM cards and put it back on and you have to keep checking your phone every 10 minutes to see if it is registered on the network or not.,
This has happened post the 4.4.2 update and I guess Motorola is actively working on a fix but no official communication yet (or at least I haven't come across). You can read multiple threads online on this issue.,
It may be fixed in 4.4.3 - but till then, I'd suggest hold on. Wait for the fix to come and then get your hands on this amazing bit of technology!                                "

                                    One of the worst eCommerce website customer handling and behavior from there executive, you people have changed alot than your past days, really sucks, you are not aware of your own policies, i am going to file a case under consumer court by taking legal advice.,
Purchased two Moto G from flipkart, one of them not at all working properly in any mean, having battery drainage problem, network signal issue, calls are getting disconnected, handset getting rebooted automatically, numbers are getting dialed automatically some times, i am struggling hard with pathetic product. there executive consider this is a valid product not willing provide me a refund as i don't want this garbage product at all.

                                    This review is about the after sales service and not about the product itself.,
As you should consider the service factor also if something goes wrong,
I bought a Moto g 16 gb black version on 23/02/2014 from flipkart.,
On 27/04/2014 the phone started restarting continously so I went to Motorola India support website. found the list of authorised service centers and on 28/04/2014 I  submitted the phone at Service center in Vashi, Navi Mumbai.,
Mobile Point,
Shop no - G-115, ground floor, Nano wing,,
Haware's Fantasia business park, behind In-orbit mall,,
Near Vashi railway station.,
Tel: 9773655793 / 27816667,
Email ID: mobilepointvashi.care@gmail.com,
Today on 02/05/2014 when I called the service center they said motorola has a server problem and the mobile can be repaired only after 15th may 2014.,
Then I had an online chat about the said issue on motorola india suport website, thay gave me another number of Mr. Ashish Patil - ashish.patil@redington.co.in Contact -,
9324395043. I called on the no. but the person is not answering the call. ,
Then I called Motorola India helpline no 1-800-102-2344 but they are saying the said service center is now unlisted but it is still showing in their authorised service center list on the website.,
My mobile is in their service center from last one week and now they are asking for two more weeks just to start working on the problem.,
It has been two months that I have bought this mobile Moto g and it has given problems in such short duration.,
Firstly i was sold me a faulty product and now am not getting any after salse service.,
Please consider buying these products as if you receive a faulty product they have absolutely pathetic after sales service.                                "

                                    I was one of the lucky few who were able to successfully order the 16GB model. I haven't seen a product on Flipkart getting sold out so quickly ( in half an hour!), especially on the day of the launch.,
Flipkart's delivery was exceptional as always and the product was delivered to me at noon today (7th February 2014, ie in 1 Day!) even though I opted for standard shipping. The box contains quick start guides (in Hindi and English), warranty card, wall charger, wired headset and of course, the stunning Moto G. An interesting observation is that the phone available in the US comes without the headset and the wall charger but instead, only has a USB cable. +1 to Motorola on giving extra stuff to Indian customers.,
Coming to the phone, not only does it have amazing hardware specs (kindly refer to the description on Flipkart, no point in repeating the same here) but it is very well designed too. The detailed observations are listed below - ,
Design -,
The Moto G has a great design and the button placement is really good, with the lock/unlock button being easily accessible, irrespective of the hand in which it is being held. The rounded edges make it feel slimmer and at around 140 grams, it is certainly not the heaviest phone around. The most striking design feature is that it is difficult to to differentiate between the display and the bezel, making the front appear like it is 'monolithic', similar to the design of Nexus devices.,
Screen -,
The 720p IPS LCD display at 329 ppi is spectacular and the colours produced are vivid and the saturation levels are very good. The viewing angles are great and the unit I received did not contain any dead pixels, as reported by a few people. The presence of Gorilla Glass 3 serves as an icing on the cake, making the Moto have the best display in its class by far.,
Processor -,
Powered by a 1.2 Ghz quad core Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 chipset with Adreno 305, there is no compromise felt in performance. Opening and switching between apps is very fast and swiping across and pinching in and out on the screen is very responsive and no lag is felt whatsoever, thanks to the 1GB of RAM. Again, no phone in this price range stands a chance against the Moto.,
Operating System -,
The OS is almost stock Android in terms of the UI and Motorola has added a few of its applications like - ,
1. Moto Assist (schedules tasks such as silencing the phone during a meeting or while sleeping), ,
2. Moto Migrate (to transfer stuff from your old phone),,
3. Moto Device ID (to track the phone if it gets lost) etc.,
These apps are very useful and consume minimal resources and hence it is highly unfair to classify them as bloatware (as some people claim). ,
The device runs Android Jelly Bean 4.3 and an upgrade to Kitkat (ie 4.4) is around the corner, which should improve performance further, adding more features at the same time.,
Camera -,
One of the most criticised features of this phone is undoubtedly the camera, which takes 5MP photos. However, when compared to my friend's Nexus 4 (which has an 8MP camera), the results were a pleasant surprise. ,
We took photos of the same object at 1X zoom and on comparison, we agreed on the fact that the pics taken by the Moto G were on par with the Nexus 4, if not better, despite having the lower megapixel count. ,
I also compared the camera with another friend's HTC Desire SV (8 MP). The Moto takes much better and sharper photos and makes the comparison feel unfair!,
This not only confirms claims that the Nexus 4 has a relatively poor camera but also proves that a higher megapixel count does not necessarily mean better photos. ,
Battery life is supposed to be good although it is too early to reach a judgement. I will be subsequently updating this review with more information.,
I would recommend the 16GB model even though it is not in stock now since the phone storage cannot be expanded due to the absence of a micro sd card slot. Waiting for some time for the same would prove to be advantageous in the longer run. ,
Overall, the device is the best phone in this price range by far, and is in fact better than many which cost more. If you are on the lookout for a phone in the sub 15K price range, look no further because it does not get better than this ...                                "

                                    Phone is awesome by it features. But wait a minute.. If you get a defective piece ..Then..,
I am unlucky to get a defective item. My touch screen is not working after 3 days of it use.,
On seeing that we can replace the products with in 30 days... I called customer care and asked them for replacement. They told techie guy will call you.. after that we will proceed.,
I got a call from techie guy and he asked me.. ,
1. Did you  change screen guard..? ( NO.. I thought to change,.. but thanks to my laziness.. But here I got a doubt..will screen guard effects touch response..),
2. Are you using charger provided by this device? (Yes absolutely.. But how charger is related to touch screen.. All Indian phone chargers are in same voltage power.. So no need to use the provided charger...?),
After all this kaun banega carode pathi questions I got a mail from flipkart that my return request is rejected..,
What the hell.? I can go to nearest service center... But why you guys making fault promises..  30 day hassle free replacement..blah..blah.. Bull S***.                                "

It has been two months that I have bought this mobile Moto g and it has given problems in such short duration.,
Firstly i was sold me a faulty product and now am not getting any after salse service.,
Please consider buying these products as if you receive a faulty product they have absolutely pathetic after sales service.                                "

                                    I was one of the lucky few who were able to successfully order the 16GB model. I haven't seen a product on Flipkart getting sold out so quickly ( in half an hour!), especially on the day of the launch.,
Flipkart's delivery was exceptional as always and the product was delivered to me at noon today (7th February 2014, ie in 1 Day!) even though I opted for standard shipping. The box contains quick start guides (in Hindi and English), warranty card, wall charger, wired headset and of course, the stunning Moto G. An interesting observation is that the phone available in the US comes without the headset and the wall charger but instead, only has a USB cable. +1 to Motorola on giving extra stuff to Indian customers.,
Coming to the phone, not only does it have amazing hardware specs (kindly refer to the description on Flipkart, no point in repeating the same here) but it is very well designed too. The detailed observations are listed below - ,
Design -,
The Moto G has a great design and the button placement is really good, with the lock/unlock button being easily accessible, irrespective of the hand in which it is being held. The rounded edges make it feel slimmer and at around 140 grams, it is certainly not the heaviest phone around. The most striking design feature is that it is difficult to to differentiate between the display and the bezel, making the front appear like it is 'monolithic', similar to the design of Nexus devices.,
Screen -,
The 720p IPS LCD display at 329 ppi is spectacular and the colours produced are vivid and the saturation levels are very good. The viewing angles are great and the unit I received did not contain any dead pixels, as reported by a few people. The presence of Gorilla Glass 3 serves as an icing on the cake, making the Moto have the best display in its class by far.,
Processor -,
Powered by a 1.2 Ghz quad core Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 chipset with Adreno 305, there is no compromise felt in performance. Opening and switching between apps is very fast and swiping across and pinching in and out on the screen is very responsive and no lag is felt whatsoever, thanks to the 1GB of RAM. Again, no phone in this price range stands a chance against the Moto.,
Operating System -,
The OS is almost stock Android in terms of the UI and Motorola has added a few of its applications like - ,
1. Moto Assist (schedules tasks such as silencing the phone during a meeting or while sleeping), ,
2. Moto Migrate (to transfer stuff from your old phone),,
3. Moto Device ID (to track the phone if it gets lost) etc.,
These apps are very useful and consume minimal resources and hence it is highly unfair to classify them as bloatware (as some people claim). ,
The device runs Android Jelly Bean 4.3 and an upgrade to Kitkat (ie 4.4) is around the corner, which should improve performance further, adding more features at the same time.,
Camera -,
One of the most criticised features of this phone is undoubtedly the camera, which takes 5MP photos. However, when compared to my friend's Nexus 4 (which has an 8MP camera), the results were a pleasant surprise. ,
We took photos of the same object at 1X zoom and on comparison, we agreed on the fact that the pics taken by the Moto G were on par with the Nexus 4, if not better, despite having the lower megapixel count. ,
I also compared the camera with another friend's HTC Desire SV (8 MP). The Moto takes much better and sharper photos and makes the comparison feel unfair!,
This not only confirms claims that the Nexus 4 has a relatively poor camera but also proves that a higher megapixel count does not necessarily mean better photos. ,
Battery life is supposed to be good although it is too early to reach a judgement. I will be subsequently updating this review with more information.,
I would recommend the 16GB model even though it is not in stock now since the phone storage cannot be expanded due to the absence of a micro sd card slot. Waiting for some time for the same would prove to be advantageous in the longer run. ,
Overall, the device is the best phone in this price range by far, and is in fact better than many which cost more. If you are on the lookout for a phone in the sub 15K price range, look no further because it does not get better than this ...                                "

                                    Phone is awesome by it features. But wait a minute.. If you get a defective piece ..Then..,
I am unlucky to get a defective item. My touch screen is not working after 3 days of it use.,
On seeing that we can replace the products with in 30 days... I called customer care and asked them for replacement. They told techie guy will call you.. after that we will proceed.,
I got a call from techie guy and he asked me.. ,
1. Did you  change screen guard..? ( NO.. I thought to change,.. but thanks to my laziness.. But here I got a doubt..will screen guard effects touch response..),
2. Are you using charger provided by this device? (Yes absolutely.. But how charger is related to touch screen.. All Indian phone chargers are in same voltage power.. So no need to use the provided charger...?),
After all this kaun banega carode pathi questions I got a mail from flipkart that my return request is rejected..,
What the hell.? I can go to nearest service center... But why you guys making fault promises..  30 day hassle free replacement..blah..blah.. Bull S***.                                "

                                    Dear all,,
     Moto g an outstanding product. But facing disappointment by the product.,
I replaced one moto g. Faced problem with its earpiece speaker. voice was getting shattered from speaker. ,
      For that product Flipkart sent an apology saying they have sent defective product by mistake. ,
          But now again with other replaced product I am facing the same problem. And this time voice shaterring  is so much worsened i cannot understand what opposite person saying. So i had to restrict my use to msging and whats app.,
     Its a service review not a product.,
                                                                  From a disappointed customer.                                 "

Product has bee sold out before a month ago and till now they didnt finalize the service rules for warranty and no warranty.,
Very worst support form Motorola.                                "
"
                                    In the box:,
Moto G,
Wall charger,
Wired headset,
Quick start guides in Hindi and English,
Warranty card,
The Phone:,
It's a vibrant HD screen that's just the right size and has a clean, stock Android interface. Viewing angles are limited but I don't mind this because it means people can't peek around your shoulder.,
The phone feels premium to hold and processing power is good, so's the RAM and the phone barely lags (though it does occasionally slow down when changing apps). The matte back panel of the phone has an extremely pleasing texture but is also a smudge magnet. Also, no screen guard was provided in the box and none can be found on flipkart.,
Both these problems, however, are solved by the flip cover I purchased with the phone, which is even more premium. The thoughtfully located Moto logo has a depression perfect for my index finger, and the magnetic felt-lined cover will autolock or unlock and clean fingerprints on your phone when you flip it. ,
The Cameras:,
No amount of smooth scrolling will make up for the halfpenny back camera and the severely inadequate 1.3 MP front camera. Although the camera is capable of shooting slo-mo videos (this is really, really cool), they are grainy and jerky. Movement in the video is not smooth and I can only put this down to low FPS. The camera is unusable in low light and is average at best in normal light. The LED flash is blinding.,
The Battery:,
Although it's too soon to say anything about battery life, from my estimates it should do 24 hrs on one full charge with moderate wifi and 3G use.,
The Accessories:,
Apart from the phone, everything in the box was majorly disappointing. The headphones feel cheap, sound substandard and are really not worth reviewing. No data cable was included in the box. Instead I received only a micro-usb wall charger. Hello, moto?,
UPDATE: I attempted to transfer files with several data cables on multiple computers and there is a glaring issue here: the phone does not stay connected for more than two minutes at a time. Windows Explorer hangs when i try to transfer multiple albums simultaneously as they take longer than 2 mins to transfer. When I first plug it into the PC it is recognised as device XT1033 but then 2 mins later it just drops off the PC and all transfers hang. Then I have to manually disconnect and reconnect the data cable, and I have another 2 minute window to transfer files before it drops off again. The phone is charging all this while, though.,
I am getting in touch with flipkart about this issue.,
UPDATE 2: I turned on USB debugging through the Developer Options and this has apparently resolved the connection-drop issue. No cause could be found for the issue I faced earlier. I will update if it returns. ,
It is worth noting that the loudspeaker is incredibly powerful and distortion-free. The ear-speaker unit is also fairly loud and does the job.,
I had come to the comforting conclusion that 8 GB models were finally out of fashion - it's 2014. Evidently I was wrong. I strongly urge everyone to invest the extra 1.5k for a 16 GB model.,
I must also mention that the power button and volume rockers were crisp and responsive when the phone arrived but have become loose within 8 hours - what the hell? ,
Price - 7/10,
Build quality - 8/10,
Pros:,
Solid build - water resistant, Corning Gorilla Glass 3,
Premium feel,
Excellent for everyday use,
Stock Android interface + 4.4 Kitkat update imminent,
Critically acclaimed price-point,
Cons:,
Mediocre cameras - both of em,
In-the-box accessories are worthless,
No screenguard included or available online, but problem solved by flipcover,
No expandable memory, though it supports OTG,
Motorola Device ID - the world renowned lost phone tracker - is not available in India ,
Verdict:,
Worthy of the hype. Almost worth the price. One of the best deals under 15k. ,
P.s.,
It took me 6 tries to get to the payment page because by the time I would get there it would be sold out, and I'd have to refresh the product page. Then when I finally placed the order at around 1315 hrs, it kept alternating between ""payment succesfully completed"" and ""transaction incomplete"". Then at 1350 hrs it finally stabilised to ""payment successfully completed"". Then flipkart started adding random orders for the 8 GB version which I had never placed. These orders are still visible now in my track orders list, even though I never placed them. They were cancelled when I called their helpline number and they revealed there were multiple technical breakdowns because of a massive influx of customers. I received my phone the next day as per the guarantee.                                "

                                    Purchased Moto G 16 GB On 06-Feb-14, Received Faulty Device, SIM 1 Slot Is Not Detecting Any SIM,
THE BEST PART IS THAT FLIPKART DELETES MY REVIEW AFTER FEW DAYS, THIS IS THE 3RD TIME THAT I AM WRITING THE SAME REVIEW ,
I had purchased a Moto G 16GB handset on 06-Feb-2014. The product was delivered on the evening of 10-Feb-2014. However, I have received a Faulty handset. The SIM 1 slot in the phone does not recognize any SIM Card. The SIM 2 slot works fine. I have tried different SIM cards but facing the same issue with SIM 1 slot. ,
I have raised a complaint regarding this on 11-Feb-2014 . I am very disappointed with the the fact that it took 3 days and around 5 calls from my side before I could  get an update from Flipkart,
Finally, on 13-Feb-2014 I called Flipkart and they told me that they would refund me the money as the item is out of stock. The refund process would take around 10 working days after the defective productive is picked up.,
They did not even bother providing me a replacement for the defective item. Instead they offered me the refund for which i have to wait for another 10-15 days.It seemed as if they were doing a great favor by offering me a refund.My point is if I do not get the handset then what was the point in taking all the pain to buy this product at a premium price on the day it was launched and on top of that I have to wait for 10-15 days for the refund. Who pays up for my lost time, effort and money????,
I am very disappointed with the kind of service that has been provided by Flipkart. I am an avid online shopper and this experience will really make me think before purchasing any item from Flipkart.,
My advice to fellow online shoppers....think well before you purchase this product from Flipkart.......you may very well land up in a situation where you receive a defective item and then you get stuck up with the refund process which would take around 10-15 days. ,
There are numerous shoppers who have received defective Moto G (16GB) phones and lamenting on the purchase with no update on when it would get replaced.                                "
"
                                    Ok so, I am sure you would have read how good this phone is and the awesome value for money proposition it provides. No debating that - the phone is awesome. But how good is a phone if you cannot make a call from it?,
To cut long story short, the network drops regularly and the phone automatically switches to airplane mode. The SIM cards are not recognised and there is no apparent reason for this. The only way to fix this is to remove the SIM cards and put it back on and you have to keep checking your phone every 10 minutes to see if it is registered on the network or not.,
This has happened post the 4.4.2 update and I guess Motorola is actively working on a fix but no official communication yet (or at least I haven't come across). You can read multiple threads online on this issue.,
It may be fixed in 4.4.3 - but till then, I'd suggest hold on. Wait for the fix to come and then get your hands on this amazing bit of technology!                                "

                                    One of the worst eCommerce website customer handling and behavior from there executive, you people have changed alot than your past days, really sucks, you are not aware of your own policies, i am going to file a case under consumer court by taking legal advice.,
Purchased two Moto G from flipkart, one of them not at all working properly in any mean, having battery drainage problem, network signal issue, calls are getting disconnected, handset getting rebooted automatically, numbers are getting dialed automatically some times, i am struggling hard with pathetic product. there executive consider this is a valid product not willing provide me a refund as i don't want this garbage product at all.

                                    This review is about the after sales service and not about the product itself.,
As you should consider the service factor also if something goes wrong,
I bought a Moto g 16 gb black version on 23/02/2014 from flipkart.,
On 27/04/2014 the phone started restarting continously so I went to Motorola India support website. found the list of authorised service centers and on 28/04/2014 I  submitted the phone at Service center in Vashi, Navi Mumbai.,
Mobile Point,
Shop no - G-115, ground floor, Nano wing,,
Haware's Fantasia business park, behind In-orbit mall,,
Near Vashi railway station.,
Tel: 9773655793 / 27816667,
Email ID: mobilepointvashi.care@gmail.com,
Today on 02/05/2014 when I called the service center they said motorola has a server problem and the mobile can be repaired only after 15th may 2014.,
Then I had an online chat about the said issue on motorola india suport website, thay gave me another number of Mr. Ashish Patil - ashish.patil@redington.co.in Contact -,
9324395043. I called on the no. but the person is not answering the call. ,
Then I called Motorola India helpline no 1-800-102-2344 but they are saying the said service center is now unlisted but it is still showing in their authorised service center list on the website.,
My mobile is in their service center from last one week and now they are asking for two more weeks just to start working on the problem.,

                                    Purchased Moto G 16 GB On 06-Feb-14, Received Faulty Device, SIM 1 Slot Is Not Detecting Any SIM,
THE BEST PART IS THAT FLIPKART DELETES MY REVIEW AFTER FEW DAYS, THIS IS THE 3RD TIME THAT I AM WRITING THE SAME REVIEW ,
I had purchased a Moto G 16GB handset on 06-Feb-2014. The product was delivered on the evening of 10-Feb-2014. However, I have received a Faulty handset. The SIM 1 slot in the phone does not recognize any SIM Card. The SIM 2 slot works fine. I have tried different SIM cards but facing the same issue with SIM 1 slot. ,
I have raised a complaint regarding this on 11-Feb-2014 . I am very disappointed with the the fact that it took 3 days and around 5 calls from my side before I could  get an update from Flipkart,
Finally, on 13-Feb-2014 I called Flipkart and they told me that they would refund me the money as the item is out of stock. The refund process would take around 10 working days after the defective productive is picked up.,
They did not even bother providing me a replacement for the defective item. Instead they offered me the refund for which i have to wait for another 10-15 days.It seemed as if they were doing a great favor by offering me a refund.My point is if I do not get the handset then what was the point in taking all the pain to buy this product at a premium price on the day it was launched and on top of that I have to wait for 10-15 days for the refund. Who pays up for my lost time, effort and money????,
I am very disappointed with the kind of service that has been provided by Flipkart. I am an avid online shopper and this experience will really make me think before purchasing any item from Flipkart.,
My advice to fellow online shoppers....think well before you purchase this product from Flipkart.......you may very well land up in a situation where you receive a defective item and then you get stuck up with the refund process which would take around 10-15 days. ,
There are numerous shoppers who have received defective Moto G (16GB) phones and lamenting on the purchase with no update on when it would get replaced.                                "

                                    Ok so, I am sure you would have read how good this phone is and the awesome value for money proposition it provides. No debating that - the phone is awesome. But how good is a phone if you cannot make a call from it?,
To cut long story short, the network drops regularly and the phone automatically switches to airplane mode. The SIM cards are not recognised and there is no apparent reason for this. The only way to fix this is to remove the SIM cards and put it back on and you have to keep checking your phone every 10 minutes to see if it is registered on the network or not.,
This has happened post the 4.4.2 update and I guess Motorola is actively working on a fix but no official communication yet (or at least I haven't come across). You can read multiple threads online on this issue.,
It may be fixed in 4.4.3 - but till then, I'd suggest hold on. Wait for the fix to come and then get your hands on this amazing bit of technology!                                "

                                    One of the worst eCommerce website customer handling and behavior from there executive, you people have changed alot than your past days, really sucks, you are not aware of your own policies, i am going to file a case under consumer court by taking legal advice.,
Purchased two Moto G from flipkart, one of them not at all working properly in any mean, having battery drainage problem, network signal issue, calls are getting disconnected, handset getting rebooted automatically, numbers are getting dialed automatically some times, i am struggling hard with pathetic product. there executive consider this is a valid product not willing provide me a refund as i don't want this garbage product at all.

                                    This review is about the after sales service and not about the product itself.,
As you should consider the service factor also if something goes wrong,
I bought a Moto g 16 gb black version on 23/02/2014 from flipkart.,
On 27/04/2014 the phone started restarting continously so I went to Motorola India support website. found the list of authorised service centers and on 28/04/2014 I  submitted the phone at Service center in Vashi, Navi Mumbai.,
Mobile Point,
Shop no - G-115, ground floor, Nano wing,,
Haware's Fantasia business park, behind In-orbit mall,,
Near Vashi railway station.,
Tel: 9773655793 / 27816667,
Email ID: mobilepointvashi.care@gmail.com,
Today on 02/05/2014 when I called the service center they said motorola has a server problem and the mobile can be repaired only after 15th may 2014.,
Then I had an online chat about the said issue on motorola india suport website, thay gave me another number of Mr. Ashish Patil - ashish.patil@redington.co.in Contact -,
9324395043. I called on the no. but the person is not answering the call. ,
Then I called Motorola India helpline no 1-800-102-2344 but they are saying the said service center is now unlisted but it is still showing in their authorised service center list on the website.,
My mobile is in their service center from last one week and now they are asking for two more weeks just to start working on the problem.,
It has been two months that I have bought this mobile Moto g and it has given problems in such short duration.,
Firstly i was sold me a faulty product and now am not getting any after salse service.,
Please consider buying these products as if you receive a faulty product they have absolutely pathetic after sales service.                                "

                                    I was one of the lucky few who were able to successfully order the 16GB model. I haven't seen a product on Flipkart getting sold out so quickly ( in half an hour!), especially on the day of the launch.,
Flipkart's delivery was exceptional as always and the product was delivered to me at noon today (7th February 2014, ie in 1 Day!) even though I opted for standard shipping. The box contains quick start guides (in Hindi and English), warranty card, wall charger, wired headset and of course, the stunning Moto G. An interesting observation is that the phone available in the US comes without the headset and the wall charger but instead, only has a USB cable. +1 to Motorola on giving extra stuff to Indian customers.,
Coming to the phone, not only does it have amazing hardware specs (kindly refer to the description on Flipkart, no point in repeating the same here) but it is very well designed too. The detailed observations are listed below - ,
Design -,
The Moto G has a great design and the button placement is really good, with the lock/unlock button being easily accessible, irrespective of the hand in which it is being held. The rounded edges make it feel slimmer and at around 140 grams, it is certainly not the heaviest phone around. The most striking design feature is that it is difficult to to differentiate between the display and the bezel, making the front appear like it is 'monolithic', similar to the design of Nexus devices.,
Screen -,
The 720p IPS LCD display at 329 ppi is spectacular and the colours produced are vivid and the saturation levels are very good. The viewing angles are great and the unit I received did not contain any dead pixels, as reported by a few people. The presence of Gorilla Glass 3 serves as an icing on the cake, making the Moto have the best display in its class by far.,
Processor -,
Powered by a 1.2 Ghz quad core Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 chipset with Adreno 305, there is no compromise felt in performance. Opening and switching between apps is very fast and swiping across and pinching in and out on the screen is very responsive and no lag is felt whatsoever, thanks to the 1GB of RAM. Again, no phone in this price range stands a chance against the Moto.,
Operating System -,
The OS is almost stock Android in terms of the UI and Motorola has added a few of its applications like - ,
1. Moto Assist (schedules tasks such as silencing the phone during a meeting or while sleeping), ,
2. Moto Migrate (to transfer stuff from your old phone),,
3. Moto Device ID (to track the phone if it gets lost) etc.,
These apps are very useful and consume minimal resources and hence it is highly unfair to classify them as bloatware (as some people claim). ,
The device runs Android Jelly Bean 4.3 and an upgrade to Kitkat (ie 4.4) is around the corner, which should improve performance further, adding more features at the same time.,
Camera -,
One of the most criticised features of this phone is undoubtedly the camera, which takes 5MP photos. However, when compared to my friend's Nexus 4 (which has an 8MP camera), the results were a pleasant surprise. ,
We took photos of the same object at 1X zoom and on comparison, we agreed on the fact that the pics taken by the Moto G were on par with the Nexus 4, if not better, despite having the lower megapixel count. ,
I also compared the camera with another friend's HTC Desire SV (8 MP). The Moto takes much better and sharper photos and makes the comparison feel unfair!,
This not only confirms claims that the Nexus 4 has a relatively poor camera but also proves that a higher megapixel count does not necessarily mean better photos. ,
Battery life is supposed to be good although it is too early to reach a judgement. I will be subsequently updating this review with more information.,
I would recommend the 16GB model even though it is not in stock now since the phone storage cannot be expanded due to the absence of a micro sd card slot. Waiting for some time for the same would prove to be advantageous in the longer run. ,
Overall, the device is the best phone in this price range by far, and is in fact better than many which cost more. If you are on the lookout for a phone in the sub 15K price range, look no further because it does not get better than this ...                                "

                                    Phone is awesome by it features. But wait a minute.. If you get a defective piece ..Then..,
I am unlucky to get a defective item. My touch screen is not working after 3 days of it use.,
On seeing that we can replace the products with in 30 days... I called customer care and asked them for replacement. They told techie guy will call you.. after that we will proceed.,
I got a call from techie guy and he asked me.. ,
1. Did you  change screen guard..? ( NO.. I thought to change,.. but thanks to my laziness.. But here I got a doubt..will screen guard effects touch response..),
2. Are you using charger provided by this device? (Yes absolutely.. But how charger is related to touch screen.. All Indian phone chargers are in same voltage power.. So no need to use the provided charger...?),
After all this kaun banega carode pathi questions I got a mail from flipkart that my return request is rejected..,
What the hell.? I can go to nearest service center... But why you guys making fault promises..  30 day hassle free replacement..blah..blah.. Bull S***.                                "
